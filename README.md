# Saliency Maps and ARL blocks For Low Quality Face Recognition using the MS1MV2-R100-Arcface (a.k.a. Arcface) net.

This repository contains the fine-tuned models, codes and LQ-Faces Dataset of my thesis: https://repositorio.uc.cl/dspace/items/f26c0919-39f0-4587-afaf-5aeebcb70271

Some useful Issues:
